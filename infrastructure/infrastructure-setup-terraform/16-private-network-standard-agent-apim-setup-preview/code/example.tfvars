# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# 1. API Management deployment can take 30-45 minutes
# 2. APIM with Internal VNet requires additional DNS configuration
# 3. Additional APIM policies and configurations need to be set up manually or with additional Terraform resources
# 4. Consider using Application Gateway if you need external access to internal APIM
